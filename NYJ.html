    <h1>A Summary Of Chapter1 and 2 On The Book, <q>Born a Crime</q> by Trevor Noah
    </h1>
        <p><q>Born a Crime</q> is a book that tells the tale of a boy growing up in apartheid South Africa. The first two chapters introduce us to the complex family of Trevor and the challenges he faces from the beginning of his birth</p>
        <p><q>Born a Crime</q> describes the illegal existence of Trevor as a mixed-race child between a black person and a white person, especially under the apartheid laws of the time, where this crime was punishable by five years of prison and a labor camp for the black person.
        </p>
        <p><b>Chapter 1</b> narrates Noah’s upbringing, with a black mother and a white father, and how the laws affected the black people living in South Africa. 
            A black person’s education was not the same as that of a white person, and all they were taught was to count simple numbers and write.
            </p>
            <p><b>Chapter 2</b> looks at the experience Noah had growing up under the experience of a strict and loving mother who instilled in him a strong sense of right and wrong.
            </p>
            <p>The themes of <b>ethnic identity</b>, the <b>role of the church</b>, and <b>resilience</b> resonate with my experience as a person who comes from Embu County in Kenya where ethnic tensions between Embu, Tharaka, and Meru, the influence of the church in the minds of people, and political strifes between the Embu and Mbeere ethnic communities shape a person’s identity by teaching them resilience and being thick-skinned.
